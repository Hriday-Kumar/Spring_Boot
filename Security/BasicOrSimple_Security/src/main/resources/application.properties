# In Basic or Simple Security of Spring Boot application we need to add only depepdency of 
# spring security nothing to do apart form adding dependency(spring-boot-starter-security). It's a single user and password based security app.
#If we run the application we get the password in log(we can see in console) is being generated 
# for user "user". That's means by default user is "user" and password is generated by application
# at runtime.

#If we want to change the user and name password then need to put credential in application
#properties file only. like below. If we define our credential in that case no password is generated 
#by application at runtime.

#Spring provide by default end points like logout, login, home.http://localhost:8761/login,  http://localhost:8761/logout
spring.security.user.name=hriday
spring.security.user.password=hriday

#If we want that multiple user can access appliation then need to go InMemory User Data Security Appliation. It is just 
#advance from BasicOrSimplle security.
